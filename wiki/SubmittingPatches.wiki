=How to submit a patch for the linux kernel=

Read :
 * /linux-2.6/Documentation/SubmittingPatches
 * /linux-2.6/Documentation/SubmitChecklist


==Make your change==

Your code change should meet the requirements in:
Documentation/CodingStyle

Trivial violations can be checked with
scripts/checkpatch.pl
You should be able to justify any violations left in the patch

Your code should pass a sparse check cleanly.
 * http://kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/


==Test your change==

 * Your change should build cleanly:
  # With all configurations of the Kernel area you are working on
    # =y,n,m
  # Cross compiled for some different architectures
  # On allyesconfig, allnoconfig and allmodconfig

==Create the patch==

{{{
cd linux-2.6
diff -up >../patches/MyNewPatch.txt
}}}

or using git

{{{
cd linux-2.6
git diff >../patches/MyNewPatch.txt
}}}

==test the patch==

unpack a clean kernel and check your patch applies cleanly
{{{
mkdir linux-test
cd linux-test
git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
patch -p0 ../patches/MyNewPatch.txt
}}}

==test your mailer==
Linux kernel patches are sent in emails as inline text, without MIME without attachments.
Because of this the *most common errors* in a first patch are wrapping or whitespace error introduced by a mailer. So it is important to determine how to send a patch in this format correctly.
To do this, simply mail the patch to yourself and apply it to a clean tree. (This is a simple but important step!)
